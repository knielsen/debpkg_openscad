Comment: This used to be derived from the original QPL'd OGL_helper.h from the
 CGAL library. The library got re-licensed to GPL-3+ (or LGPL-3+, for other
 parts) in its 4.0 version, with no significant changes to the OGL_helper.h
 file. So while the file in here claims to be QPL derived, it can be
 equivalently thought of being derived from the new OGL_helper.h in CGAL4,
 which can be obtained from
 https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/30225/CGAL-4.0-beta1.tar.gz
 and states in its current license section exactly what is here shown in this
 DEP5 file's License: section.
