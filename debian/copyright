Comment: For the +dfsg version, icons/flattr.png was removed. It seems that the
 company holding the flattr trademark is ok with applications integratin this,
 but there is no explicit confirmation thereof, and if there was, it can be
 expected that the terms of use violate DFSG.

Comment:
 According to the file format description referenced by the author at
 <https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/494>,
 <http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/>, "<license>CC0</license>"
 has to be looked up in Fedora's list of well-known licenses at
 <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing>, which finally
 mentions the creativecommons.org URL in the license text section.

Copyright: © 1997-2002 Max-Planck-Institute Saarbruecken (Germany)
License: GPL-3+
Comment: This used to be derived from the original QPL'd OGL_helper.h from the
 CGAL library. The library got re-licensed to GPL-3+ (or LGPL-3+, for other
 parts) in its 4.0 version, with no significant changes to the OGL_helper.h
 file. So while the file in here claims to be QPL derived, it can be
 equivalently thought of being derived from the new OGL_helper.h in CGAL4,
 which can be obtained from
 https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/30225/CGAL-4.0-beta1.tar.gz
 and states in its current license section exactly what is here shown in this
 DEP5 file's License: section.

Comment: given no other indication, it is assumed that most of the file stems
 from the OpenSCAD authors (see `Files: *`). However, it contains a note that
 "Some portions of the code below are: Copyright (C) 1999-2001  Brian Paul   All
 Rights Reserved." with an MIT/X11 license following. Given it is a mix of
 GPL-2+ with CGAL exception and MIT code, it makes it GPL-2+ with CGAL
 exception after all. The complete license text for the portions:

 licenses.

 Alternatively, this file may be used under the terms of the GNU Lesser
 General Public License version 2.1 as published by the Free Software

 rights.  These rights are described in the Nokia Qt LGPL Exception
 version 1.1, included in the file LGPL_EXCEPTION.txt in this package.
Comment: The LGPL_EXCEPTION.txt is not shipped upstream. It seems from the
 file' contents that it was derived from the qcache.h file found in the
 libqt4-dev package as /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qcache.h (or another version of
 the same file), which ships an LGPL_EXCEPTION.txt file which says:

 Moreover, you may apply this exception to a modified version of the Library,
 provided that such modification does not involve copying material from the

 limited to (i) numerical parameters; (ii) data structure layouts;
 (iii) accessors; and (iv) small macros, templates and inline functions of
 five lines or less in length.
