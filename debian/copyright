Files-Excluded: libraries/MCAD
Comment: The MCAD library is free, included in upstream's tar ball, but not
 part of upstream's git tree, and packaged independently.
 .
 Until before 2015.03-2, upstream shipped the non-free flattr logo, which
 warranted the creation of a +dfsg package. The remaining non-free parts are
 being tracked at https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1491; it is
 expected that future versions can be debian-released with original tar balls.

Comment: This used to be derived from the original QPL'd OGL_helper.h from the
 CGAL library. The library got re-licensed to GPL-3+ (or LGPL-3+, for other
 parts) in its 4.0 version, with no significant changes to the OGL_helper.h
 file. So while the file in here claims to be QPL derived, it can be
 equivalently thought of being derived from the new OGL_helper.h in CGAL4,
 which can be obtained from
 https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/30225/CGAL-4.0-beta1.tar.gz
 and states in its current license section exactly what is here shown in this
 DEP5 file's License: section.

 Creative Commons Legal Code
 .
 CC0 1.0 Universal
 .
     CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
     LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
     ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
     INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
     REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
     PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
     THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
     HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
 of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
 works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
 and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
 These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
 culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
 works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
 part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
 is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
 terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
 Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;
  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;
  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
      directive); and
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
      implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
 medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
 including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
 purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
 member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
 successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
 revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
 equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
 as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
 irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
 maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
 time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
 of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
 limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
 "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
 applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
 partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
 of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
 will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
 Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
 action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
     the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
     the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
     Work.
  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
     this CC0 or use of the Work.

 so the python license is included below.

 .
 A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
 ==========================
 .
 Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
 Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
 as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
 principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
 .
 In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
 National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
 in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
 software.
 .
 In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
 BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
 year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
 Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
 Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
 non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
 Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
 the PSF.
 .
 All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
 the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
 releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
 the various releases.
 .

                     from                                compatible? (1)

     2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
 .
 Footnotes:
 .
 (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
 .
 (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
     is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
 .
 Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
 direction to make these releases possible.
